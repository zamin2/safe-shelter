# UI Mockups prior to development of application

**NOTE:** We designed the mockups in line with the requirements of our client using Microsoft Visio. After these designs were completed and approved in our first sprint, we used these mockup designs as a guide to start developing the front-end of our application in the next sprint. After the first sprint, there were some design and UI changes proposed gradually by our client and we adjusted our final UI accordingly.
